# CryptoClustering-Challenge

With the file uploaded into Github, to view the code you must first download the raw data because it was too large to upload into Github. So to bypass this issue I needed to link my google colab account to directly upload it into Github.

For the challenge, we broke down crypto coins into a scatter plot by change in price percentage by day and hour. We also use PCA clustering to try an predict an outcome as well.
